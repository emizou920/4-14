Class object1 = new Class(2);
Class object2 = new Class(object1);

constants value
public static fianl datatype CONST_NAME = value;
almost always static and final
The reason make constants static because does not want it change
but why set it public?

pass by reference send a location of the variable  eg: sharing a google docs link (we both can change the docs)

pass by value eg: attaching a doc in an email / sending hw on canvas (as long as you sent the file, any change in my file the other person don't know)

Think of primitive as pass by value
Think of objects as pass by reference(maybe not true but works)
